All are correct - the model was asked to find the "single venue",
all three format choices led to the model picking a valid answer.
We were possibly expecting some incorrect responses even without the distractors,
but the model did very well.

I suspect 'The New Town Vault'. It isn't vegan,
but its description does contain the word vegan.
So the model has to correctly determine that 'vegan=no'
means not vegan.

# Explain what Part C showed, or why it wasn't needed. Minimum 30 words.
PART_C_EXPLANATION = """
It showed that Gemma 2 2B is actually better than expected.
We included this stress test under the anticipation that it would fail at one of these tasks.
However it still correctly identified a valid venue in all three formats.
It is, however, the first response to not include the definite article before 'Haymarket'.

# ── Core lesson ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# Complete this sentence. Minimum 40 words.
# "Context formatting matters most when..."

CORE_LESSON = """
Context formatting matters most when the model isn't powerful - 
that's what the core lesson was meant to be, I believe.
However, in this run the small model got lucky (always a danger with non-deterministic processes),
and in all three context formats got the answer correct.
